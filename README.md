# python_hackrf

python_hackrf is a cython wrapper for hackrf (https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/hackrf).

You can install this library using
```
pip install python_hackrf
```
Or assemble it manually using the following steps:

In order to build the library you need to go to the python_hackrf directory
```
cd python_hackrf
```
call
```
python setup.py build_ext --inplace.
```
If the build fails, you will need to specify the paths for the libusb library.
```
CFLAGS="-I/path to libusb.h /libusb-1.0" \
LDFLAGS="-L/path to libusb-1.0.so /lib" \
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```
## Requirements:
* Cython==0.29.36
* Numpy>=1.26
* Scipy (optional, for faster work)

## hackrf:
Almost all the functionality of the standard library is implemented. Some features will be added later. (operacake).

## hackrf tools:
* hackrf_clock.c (Not implemented)
* hackrf_cpldjtag.c (Not implemented)
* hackrf_debug.c (Not implemented. But functions for this are implemented)
* hackrf_info.c (Implemented + additionally added output of only serial numbers)
* hackrf_operacake.c (Not implemented and the functions are also not implemented. Will be added in the future)
* hackrf_spiflash.c (Not implement. I wonâ€™t implement them because this is a dangerous zone)
* hackrf_sweep.c (Implemented)
* hackrf_transfer.c (Not implemented. Will be added in the future)

## usage
```
usage: python -m python_hackrf [-h] {info, sweep} ...

python_hackrf is a Python wrapper for libhackrf and hackrf-tools.

options:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit

Available commands:
  {info,sweep}
    info        Read device information from HackRF such as serial number and firmware version.
    sweep       a command-line spectrum analyzer.
```
```
usage: python -m python_hackrf info [-h] [-f] [-s]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f, --full            show info like in hackrf_info
  -s, --serial_numbers  show only founded serial_numbers
```
```
usage: python -m python_hackrf sweep [-h] [-d] [-a] [-f] [-p] [-l] [-g] [-w] [-1] [-N] [-I] [-r]

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

  -B          binary output. If specified = Enable
  -r          filename. output file
```
## Note
This library can work on android. To do this, go to the android directory and download two recipes for p4a.
## Examples
Examples will be added later.
